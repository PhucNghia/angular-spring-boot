# java-angular-basic

This is a quick starter for projects using Spring Boot as backend and Angular as frontend.

You find a detailled description in this post:

And a demo of the installation in this video:

To the basic example I added some 'showcase' extra features:
- Test with MockMvc
- Test with RestTemplateTest
- OpenApi using Spring Doc (code first). Swagger-ui is accessible here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui
